# RuneLite Identifier Plugin
A Plugin for RuneLite that displays object and NPC IDs on mouse-over.

Displays the object or NPC ID value above a moused-over entity in the game world, or when hovered over in the right-click menu. Colours of NPC and object highlight outlines can be modified in the config panel. Drawing the outline and the ID value can both be toggled.

Next Steps:
1. Display target ID and name in chatbox on Examine
2. Display on-hover object IDs above model (currently no native way of finding object model height ðŸ˜–)
3. Toggle ability to display IDs above every rendered NPC and object in current 3D view
4. Custom text colour independent of highlight outline colour
